# beadmodel-relaxing (rapid-dynamics)
Repo for relaxing rod tests on the bead model.

This branch contains the code investigating the rapid dynamics observed over very short time at the beginning of the relaxing rod simulation tests of the bead model.

Master .m files are edited to include only a filament of 71 beads, initially pulled into a slightly tighter parabola than the previous relaxing tests and then released, checking for smooth motion through the previous initial position.
